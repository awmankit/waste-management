                <h4>Incineration</h4>
                <p>Incineration is a waste treatment process that involves the combustion of substances contained in waste materials.[1] Industrial plants for waste incineration are commonly referred to as waste-to-energy facilities. Incineration of waste materials converts the waste into ash, flue gas and heat.</p>
